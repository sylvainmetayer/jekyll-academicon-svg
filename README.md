Use all of [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/) without the need to import the full css / svg.

This Jekyll plugin will look for the icons you include in your page and only include the icons you used.

## Usage

- When you want to include an icon, you can use the same name as you will do to with Academicons

    `{% a_svg google-scholar %}`

    or

    `{% a_svg 'google-scholar' %}`

    Each icon get the `academic-icon` class, which you can use in your CSS to customize the appearance of your icon.

- You will need to have in **one** part of your project (at the end of your layout for example) liquid tag to generate the SVG definition.

    The syntax is this one `{% a_svg_generate %}`
